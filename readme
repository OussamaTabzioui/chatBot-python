# AI-Powered Chatbot

An AI-powered chatbot built with Python, leveraging NLP models for paraphrasing, sentiment analysis, and Wikipedia integration. This chatbot can remember user details across sessions, respond to questions, and provide personalized interactions.

## Features

- **Personalized Greetings**: Greets users by name and remembers their location and other details across sessions.
- **Session-Based and Long-Term Memory**: Stores user information like name, age, and location in a JSON file for personalized interactions in future sessions.
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Checks a predefined knowledge base for answers before searching Wikipedia.
- **Wikipedia Integration**: Fetches concise answers from Wikipedia when the knowledge base doesn't have the answer.
- **Learning Capability**: Learns new answers from user inputs and stores them in the knowledge base for future use.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of user inputs to provide empathetic responses.
- **Conversation History**: Maintains a history of conversations within a session.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-powered-chatbot.git
   cd ai-powered-chatbot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the necessary models:**

   The chatbot uses the following models:
   - **Paraphrasing Model**: [Vamsi/T5_Paraphrase_Paws](https://huggingface.co/Vamsi/T5_Paraphrase_Paws)
   - **Sentiment Analysis Model**: (Pre-trained sentiment-analysis model from Hugging Face)

   These models will be automatically downloaded when you first run the chatbot.

## Usage

To start the chatbot, run:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

The chatbot will greet you and start interacting. Type your questions or statements, and the bot will respond based on its knowledge base, Wikipedia, or learned responses. Type `quit` to exit the chatbot.

## Example Interaction

```
Bot: Hello, what's your name?
You: My name is Oussama.
Bot: Nice to meet you, Oussama!
You: I am from Morocco.
Bot: Wow, Morocco is a great place!
You: How old is the Earth?
